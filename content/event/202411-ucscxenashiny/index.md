summary: 介绍UCSCXenaShiny的开发历史与使用方式。
abstract: 'The continuous generation of multi-omics and phenotype data is propelling advancements in precision oncology. UCSCXenaShiny was developed as an interactive tool for exploring thousands of cancer datasets available on UCSC Xena. However, its capacity for comprehensive and personalized pan-cancer data analysis is being challenged by the growing demands. Here, we introduce UCSCXenaShiny v2, a milestone update through a variety of improvements.'
