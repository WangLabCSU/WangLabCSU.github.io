abstract: 'The continuous generation of multi-omics and phenotype data is propelling advancements in precision oncology. UCSCXenaShiny was developed as an interactive tool for exploring thousands of cancer datasets available on UCSC Xena. However, its capacity for comprehensive and personalized pan-cancer data analysis is being challenged by the growing demands. Here, we introduce UCSCXenaShiny v2, a milestone update through a variety of improvements. Firstly, by integrating multidimensional data and implementing adaptable sample settings, we create a suite of robust TPC (TCGA, PCAWG, CCLE) analysis pipelines. These pipelines empower users to conduct in-depth analyses of correlation, comparison, and survival in three modes: Individual, Pan-cancer and Batch screen. Additionally, the tool includes download interfaces that enable users to access diverse data and outcomes, several features also facilitate the joint analysis of drug sensitivity and multi-omics of cancer cell lines. UCSCXenaShiny v2 is an open-source R package and a web application, freely accessible at https://github.com/openbiox/UCSCXenaShiny.'
